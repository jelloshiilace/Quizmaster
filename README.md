# Quizmaster
## An Interactive Quiz Game

"Quizmaster" is an interactive quiz game which allows the user to play a multiple choice quiz.

The game has ten questions and four choices per question. It displays a question bar at the top which can be used to jump between questions. At the end, the quiz displays the score obtained along with the current highscore. It also displays the correct answers to the questions.

The quiz follows a simple function-based code, with the questions stored in a separate csv file from where they are randomly picked each time the quiz is run. The high score is tracked using a text file which is updated every time a game is finished.

The interface is designed using the Tkinter module to make the quiz presentable and aesthetically pleasing.
